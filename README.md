This repository contains a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game, implemented in Python. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid, following the classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Features:

Two-player mode where players take turns to input their moves.
The game checks for a win condition after each move, identifying if a player has successfully aligned three of their marks (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game also detects a draw if all spots are filled without any player winning.
A clean and intuitive command-line interface that prompts players for their moves and displays the current state of the board after each turn.
Option to restart the game or exit after each match.

This project is a great demonstration of using Python's control flow structures, such as loops and conditionals, and basic data structures like lists to manage the game board. It's an excellent project for beginners to enhance their programming skills by building a classic, interactive game.
